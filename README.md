## Calculate the Photoexited Carrier Density After Pulsed Laser Excitation in Semiconductors (i.e. Perovskites)

## Overview

This code can be used to calculate the laser fluence and photoexcited carrier density in a thin film after laser excitation. The user will have to input values such as the laser excitation wavelength, power, repetition rate, geometry of the laser excitation profile, optical density of the thin film at the laser excitation wavelength, and film thickness. Values for a standard metal halide perovskite film are used as an example.
