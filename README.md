## Calculate the Photoexited Carrier Density After Pulsed Laser Excitation in Semiconductors (i.e. Perovskites)

* [Overview of Script and Functionality](#Overview)

## Overview

This code can be used to calculate the laser fluence and photoexcited carrier density after laser excitation. The user will have to input values such as the laser excitation wavelength, power, repetition rate, geometry of laser excitation profile, optical density of the thin film, and film thickness. Values for a standard metal halide perovskite film are used as an example.
